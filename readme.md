## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 5 - Database Engine Assignment

### Problem Statement

Until step 4, we are not fetching data from the file.

In this step, we will begin executing the queries - we will read the data from the CSV file based on to the query and filter the fields and records based on "select" and "where" condition. 
We will store the extracted data in a separate JSON file named result.json.

**Please note that in this step, we are not handling aggregate functions, group by and order by.** 

For Example
1. Filter the data based on selected fields.

            Query : select city,winner,team1,team2 from data/ipl.csv;
            Expected Output in JSON file:

                       {
                          "1": {
                            "winner": "Kolkata Knight Riders",
                            "city": "Bangalore",
                            "team1": "Kolkata Knight Riders",
                            "team2": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"
                          },
                          "2": {
                            "winner": "Chennai Super Kings",
                            "city": "Chandigarh",
                            "team1": "Chennai Super Kings",
                            "team2": "Kings XI Punjab"
                          },
                          "3": {
                            "winner": "Delhi Daredevils",
                            "city": "Delhi",
                            "team1": "Rajasthan Royals",
                            "team2": "Delhi Daredevils"
                          },
                          "4": {
                            "winner": "Royal Challengers Bangalore",
                            "city": "Mumbai",
                            "team1": "Mumbai Indians",
                            "team2": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"
                          },
                          "5": {
                            "winner": "Kolkata Knight Riders",
                            "city": "Kolkata",
                            "team1": "Deccan Chargers",
                            "team2": "Kolkata Knight Riders"
                          }, ......
                             ......
                        }


2. Filter the data based on the query with multiple where conditions.
                  
            Query : select city, win_by_runs, season from data/ipl.csv where season > 2014 and city ='Bangalore'
            Expected output in JSON File:
                    {
                      "1": {
                        "city": "Bangalore",
                        "season": "2015",
                        "win_by_runs": "0"
                      },
                      "2": {
                        "city": "Bangalore",
                        "season": "2015",
                        "win_by_runs": "18"
                      },
                      "3": {
                        "city": "Bangalore",
                        "season": "2015",
                        "win_by_runs": "27"
                      },
                      "4": {
                        "city": "Bangalore",
                        "season": "2015",
                        "win_by_runs": "0"
                      },
                      "5": {
                        "city": "Bangalore",
                        "season": "2015",
                        "win_by_runs": "0"
                      }, .....
                         .....
                    }


`Note : Once you have cloned boilerplate from the given gitlab URL, import the project into eclipse. 
Your project’s test cases might show compile time errors for methods, as you have not written the complete code.`

### Expected solution

A JSON file containing the filtered result set.

### Following are the broad tasks:

- Read the query from the user
- parse the query
- forward the object of query parameter to CsvQueryProcessor
- filter out rows basis on the conditions mentioned in the where clause
- write the result set into a JSON file

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step5** of your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-dev.stackroute.in/datamunger-java/step-5-boilerplate.git assignment-solution-step5`

2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step5 folder

    `cd assignment-solution-step5`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step5` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab.training.com/{{yourusername}}/assignment-solution-step5.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
